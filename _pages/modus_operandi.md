## Values

### Code of Ethics
We believe in the silliness of others regardless of

- race or ethnicity,
- sex,
- gender identity or expression,
- sexual or romantic orientation,
- age,
- ability,
- marital or relationship status,
- religion,
- native language,
- national origin or nationality,
- geographic location,
- socioeconomic status,
- caste,
- or background.

One's actions displays one's character, not the ingredients on one's label.

We do not support hate speech, bigotry, or needless harm towards others.

### Code of Conduct
Here it is implored and expected that one shows support, empathy, and hospitality
to others regardless of one's skillset and previously listed attributes.
